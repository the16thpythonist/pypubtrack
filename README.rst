Overview
========

`pypubtrack` is a python client interface for the PubTrack_ web applications. PubTrack is a web application, which can
be installed on a web server and which provides a web UI for tracking the scientific publications of a workgroup or
a whole institute by defining a list of observed authors. All publications published by any one of these observed
authors will be imported into the PubTrack database and a Status will be assigned based on the attributes of this
publication and a set of rules of how these attributes are *supposed to* look like.

The PubTrack web app is implemented as a REST API for the backend and a VueJS single page application as the frontend.
As it exposes a REST API, there are vast options for this client interface to interact with the application...
